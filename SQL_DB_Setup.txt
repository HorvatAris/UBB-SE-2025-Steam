In order to get the current version of the SQL DB running, do this:
- in SSMS create a DB named "FinalSteamDB"
- on that DB run the entire SQL code from the FinalDataInit.sql file from the main folder of this repo
- change the connection string in appsettings.json(two files - the one in SteamProfile and the one in SteamWebAPI) to your server's name such that it looks like:
    "LocalDataSource": "YOURSERVERSNAME",
    "InitialCatalog": "FinalSteamDB",
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOURSERVERSNAME;Database=FinalSteamDB;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
    }
